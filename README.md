# Market-Segmentation-Using-Geospatial-Analysis-in-Python
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Visualize various market segments, and identification of indicator variables that influence sales patterns through time in Kenya. 

Based on patterns discovered from the sales data. We have some variables
(indicators) for creation of an index based on variables that you think influence sales patterns. 

Use whichever datasets you find relevant in the folder. 

Customers in any setting/industry are typically associated with a location. In the banking world, these 
locations are usually branching. Sometimes the relationships are explicit - the customer has a pattern 
of regularly visiting the location.

Understanding the characteristics of your market area such as consumer demographics and 
consumption pattern helps you better understand who your customers are and how to effectively 
reach them.

The type of questions we would like to answer around doing a segmentation analysis on a customer 
data set are:
I. Which market segments are important?
II. How can micro markets around these customers be defined?
III. Which micro markets yield the best opportunities for revenue growth? (Identify target 
markets)
IV. Where can we find more of these potential markets?

Based on the above pattern you will discover from the sales data. We have provided some variables
(indicators) for creation of an index based on variables that you think influence sales patterns. Use 
whichever datasets you find relevant in the folder. 
You are also allowed to enrich your data from other sources.
